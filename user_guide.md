# Site User Guide
## Logging In

You log into your site by going to the home page and appending `/cp` (for control panel) to the URL.  This will take you to a login page where you will enter the username and password that was provided to you.

Once logged in, you will see a screen similar to this:

## Content Types

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.25.06%20AM.png)

The main menu to the left has four types of content.  This may be confusing so let's go through what each of them do (from the bottom up):


### Globals

Globals are where we store site-wide settings.  Things like your address and social media links, what navigation and footer style you want to use, and your logo will be stored under globals.  **Basically, if its something that is going to show up on multiple places under your sight - this is the place to look for it.**


### Assets

Assets are where we store files like images and word documents.  In all likelihood, you won't be accessing this directly very often, but will interact with assets through pages and collections.  So don't worry about this.

### Collections

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.28.40%20AM.png)

Collections are where we store and create content with a repeatable structure that are grouped together by similar characteristics.

Blog posts are a good example: Your site will (hopefully) have many blog posts, but each one is going to have share common characteristics such as a title, subtitle, date, and featured image.

Other uses of collections could be:
* Photo galleries
* Testimonials
* Team/Staff entries
* Sermons
* Classes

We can create custom forms for any collection you can think of.  It's very powerful.

Collection entries can be their own page (like blog posts) or just repeated things on one page (like testimonials).  It's up to you.


### Pages

Pages are, well, pages.  They can be as similar or dissimilar as you choose and they make up the menu of your site.  Some pages, like the gallery and blog pages, exist only as entry points for collections and require custom themes - these cannot be edited and only exist so you can rearrange them in the menu.  But you should have full control over any other kind of page and you can create as many as you like.

#### What is a slug?

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.51.55%20AM.png)

At the top of every page there will be a title field and a "slug" field.  The "slug" confuses people. A slug is just your title without spaces or special characters so it can be a part of the URL.  (i.e. http://yoursite.com/your-awesome-title-here).  Because it's a part of the URL, it has to be unique and on **very rare** occasions you may have to edit it to make sure that it is unique.  99% of the time you won't touch this.

#### Position in Menu

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.37.49%20AM.png)

When you create a page, you'll have the option of choosing it's menu position.  (This means nothing in Menu Style 3.). You can choose to display the page in the left side of the menu or the right side of the menu, or as a Call To Action button.

Consider the following illustration as an explanation:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.39.29%20AM.png)

Call to Action buttons are always positioned at the far right and given special emphasis.

#### Nesting Pages

Some pages need to be nested under other pages. For example, you may want to have an "about page" be the parent and then have pages for "our history", "our staff", "our beliefs", etc.

To nest a page first create it, then go back to the pages screen and click and drag the "Handle" on the far left of the page list and move the page until it is where you want it and appears like the "Team Members" page in the illustration below:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.44.57%20AM.png)

## Creating “Basic” Pages

Most of your pages will just be text content with some images.  To create one of these pages, click the "Create Page" button from the Pages screen:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.47.49%20AM.png)

Then select "Default" from the menu that pops up:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.48.27%20AM.png)

### Elements of a "Basic" page:

Every basic page has the following:

* Title - you have to call it something.
* Slug - see above.
* Featured Image - (Optional) upload an image for the page.  If you don't upload one, the default one (from globals) will be shown.
* Text - see below...

### The Mighty *Text* Field

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.56.00%20AM.png)

Our text field is designed to be both simple and powerful.  Just type away and you'll have a nice, distraction free place to write.  (You can even make it full screen and be *really* distraction free.)

But when you highlight a word or sentence, you'll be presented with a little pop-up menu where you can make things bold, italic, add a link or designate your sentence as a heading.

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.58.59%20AM.png)

But that's not all this field can do, when you start a new blank line, you'll see a "plus" icon to the right.  Clicking it will show you a host of other things you can add to your page.

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.59.30%20AM.png)


### Sidebar (Optional)

Basic text pages can have an optional sidebar.  To toggle the sidebar, scroll below the text field and click the "Show Sidebar" toggle.

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%209.47.00%20AM.png)

Sidebars can show two things: a submenu and latest posts.

The **submenu** has no options and just shows the other pages underneath the same parent as the currently selected page.  If your page is top level, nothing will be shown here.

***Latest Posts*** has only one option - allowing you to choose between styles of latest post lists.  This will show your three latest blog posts in the sidebar.


## Creating "Special" Pages

Sometimes a basic page isn't enough and you want to create a special page with unique layout features to emphasize something.  We've got you covered.  Our "Special" page template allows you to mix and match dozens of layout blocks to create a unique all kinds of unique and interesting pages.

To create one of these pages, click the "Create Page" button from the Pages screen:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.47.49%20AM.png)

Then select "Special Pages" from the menu that pops up:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%208.48.27%20AM.png)

Like basic pages, special pages have a title, a slug, featured image and menu-position options but in the place of the text box you get this:

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%209.54.42%20AM.png)

This is called a "replicator" field and will allow you to create, mix and match and rearrange any number of "blocks."  Simply select the block you want, add content according to the instructions, and then rearrange as you see fit.

### Special Blocks:

A few of the blocks serve a special purpose:

* Latest Posts, Gallery, Teams and Testimonials blocks have few options and let you display a stylized listing of your blog posts, images, teams or testimonials.
*  Signup blocks display a form, and may require extra coding from your developer.


## Creating Blog Posts

To create a blog post, click on "Collections" and then "Blog" and then "Create Entry."

![](http://sitesforchurch.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-05-16%20at%2012.56.32%20PM.png)

A blog post is very similar to a "Basic" text page with a few added features:

* **Title and Subtitle** - Our blog posts have a subtitle option as well as a title option.  The subtitle should be a one sentence description of the post.
* **Author** - Authors can be picked from the team members collection.
* **Feature** - If you want to feature the blog post on the blog page so that it stays at the top of the blog list, click the feature toggle.
* **Enable Comments** - Enables Disqus comments on this post.  See below...

## Setting Up Comments

Our comments are handled by Disqus.  In order for this to work, you'll need to go into the comments section and find the Disqus toggle and add your Disqus site ID.
